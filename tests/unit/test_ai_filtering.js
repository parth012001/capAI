I've been following your work and really admire what you're building. At Kalyxa, we're working on a platform that makes fashion styling smarter and more accessible through AI. I believe there could be a strong opportunity for us to collaborate, especially around [specific area, e.g., digital wardrobes, influencer campaigns, or customer engagement].

Would you be open to a quick chat to explore how we might work together? I think there's real synergy here.

Best,
Parth`
