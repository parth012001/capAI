    baseResponse: string, 
    senderRelationship: string, 
    previousInteractions: ParsedEmail[]
  ): Promise<string>
}
```

#### **🔄 Complete End-to-End Workflow**

##### **📧 Step 1: Meeting Request Detection (Existing Phase 3.2)**
```javascript
// Email arrives: "Hi Parth, can we sync on Q4 project? 30 min this week?"
const meetingRequest = await meetingDetectionService.detectMeetingRequest(email);
// Result: { duration: 30, urgency: 'medium', preferredDates: ['this week'] }
```

##### **⚡ Step 2: Auto-Scheduling Initiation (NEW Phase 3.3)**
```javascript
// Automatically triggered when meeting request detected
const workflow = await autoSchedulingService.processDetectedMeetingRequest(meetingRequest);

// Phase 3.3 Workflow Steps:
// 1. Find available time slots (using Phase 3.1)
// 2. Create provisional calendar holds
// 3. Generate personalized response (using Phase 2.3)
// 4. Send response with time options
// 5. Monitor for recipient reply
```

##### **📅 Step 3: Intelligent Time Finding + Calendar Holds**
```javascript
// Uses Phase 3.1 calendar intelligence
const timeSlots = await calendarService.suggestTimeSlots(30, 'this-week');
// Result: 3 optimal time slots with confidence scores

// Creates temporary calendar holds (NEW)
const holds = await autoSchedulingService.createProvisionalCalendarHolds(timeSlots);
// Result: 30-minute holds block the time slots to prevent double-booking
```

##### **📤 Step 4: Automated Response Generation + Sending**
```javascript
// Generates personalized response using Phase 2.2 context + Phase 2.3 response generation
const response = await autoSchedulingService.generateSchedulingResponse(meetingRequest, holds);

// Generated response example:
const responseBody = `
Hi Sarah,

I'd be happy to sync on the Q4 project! I have a few time slots available this week:

🗓️ **Tuesday, Sept 3rd**
   • 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM PT (30 minutes)
