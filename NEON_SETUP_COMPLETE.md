# ✅ NEON Database Setup Complete!

## Status

**Database:** NEON PostgreSQL (Cloud)
**Vector Search:** 100% READY

### Stats:
- ✅ pgvector extension installed (v0.8.0)
- ✅ 466 total emails
- ✅ 466 emails with embeddings (100% coverage)
- ✅ Semantic search fully functional

---

## Important: Always Use NEON

Your `.env` file is correctly configured:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...@...neon.tech/neondb
```

**However**, your shell had a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable pointing to localhost, which was overriding the `.env` file.

### To Always Use NEON:

**When starting your server:**
```bash
unset DATABASE_URL && npm run dev
```

Or just restart your terminal (closes the session with the override).

## Testing Semantic Search

### 1. Backend is Ready
The API endpoint exists at: `GET /emails/search?q=your query`

### 2. Frontend is Ready
Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/search

### 3. Try These Queries:
- "software engineer jobs"
- "AI stocks"
- "meeting invitations"
- "LinkedIn messages"

## How It Works

**Hybrid Search (70% semantic + 30% keyword)**
1. User types natural language query
2. OpenAI generates embedding for query
3. PostgreSQL finds similar email embeddings (vector similarity)
4. Also does keyword matching (full-text search)
5. Combines both with 70/30 weighting
6. Returns most relevant emails

## Next Steps

**Now ready for:** Voice AI Assistant integration
- Voice recording
- Speech-to-text (Whisper)
- AI processing
- Text-to-speech

## Troubleshooting

If you see "column embedding does not exist":
1. Check which database you're connected to
2. Run: `unset DATABASE_URL`
3. Restart your server

If embeddings are missing:
```bash
unset DATABASE_URL && npx tsx scripts/backfill_embeddings.ts
```
