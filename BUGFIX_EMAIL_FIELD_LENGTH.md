# Bug Fix: Email Field Length Issue

## Problem Description

The application was encountering database errors when processing emails:

```
‚ùå Error saving promotional email: error: value too long for type character varying(255)
```

This error occurred in two locations:
1. `PromotionalEmailModel.savePromotionalEmail()` (line 78)
2. `EmailModel.saveEmailAndMarkAsWebhookProcessedForUser()` (line 241)

## Root Cause

The `from_email` and `to_email` columns in both the `emails` and `promotional_emails` tables were defined as `VARCHAR(255)`, which is too short for several real-world scenarios:

1. **Multiple Recipients**: When an email has multiple recipients, the `to_email` field can contain a comma-separated list of email addresses with display names (e.g., `"John Doe" <john@example.com>, "Jane Smith" <jane@example.com>`)

2. **Display Names**: Email addresses with display names like `"Company Name - Marketing Department" <marketing@example.com>` can easily exceed 255 characters

3. **Long Email Addresses**: Some organizations use very long email addresses or have long domain names

## Solution

Changed the data type from `VARCHAR(255)` to `TEXT` for the following columns:
- `emails.from_email`
- `emails.to_email`
- `promotional_emails.from_email`
- `promotional_emails.to_email`

### Migration Steps

1. **Drop dependent view**: The `meeting_pipeline_detailed` view depended on `emails.from_email`, so it needed to be dropped before altering the column type

2. **Alter column types**: Changed `VARCHAR(255)` to `TEXT` for all four email fields

3. **Recreate view**: Recreated the `meeting_pipeline_detailed` view with the same definition

4. **Update schema files**: Updated all relevant schema files to reflect the change

## Files Modified

### Migration Files
- `/Users/parthahir/Desktop/chief/src/database/migrations/fix_email_field_length.ts` - TypeScript migration script
- `/Users/parthahir/Desktop/chief/scripts/database/fix_email_field_length.sql` - SQL migration script

### Schema Files
- `/Users/parthahir/Desktop/chief/scripts/database/complete_working_schema.sql` - Updated to TEXT
- `/Users/parthahir/Desktop/chief/scripts/database/promotional_emails_schema.sql` - Updated to TEXT

## Verification

üìä Column types after migration:
  - emails.from_email: text
  - emails.to_email: text
  - promotional_emails.from_email: text
  - promotional_emails.to_email: text
```

## Impact

- **Performance**: TEXT fields have no practical performance difference from VARCHAR for email addresses in PostgreSQL. Both can be indexed efficiently.

- **Storage**: TEXT fields are slightly more efficient than VARCHAR(255) in PostgreSQL because they don't store the length limit.

- **Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work without changes. The application code doesn't need any modifications.

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Send an email with multiple recipients (long `to_email` field)
2. Send an email with display names in the from/to fields
3. Monitor the console logs to ensure no more "value too long" errors

## Prevention

For future database schema design:
- Use `TEXT` for email fields that may contain multiple addresses or display names
- Use `VARCHAR(255)` only for single email addresses without display names
- Use `TEXT` for any field that may contain user-generated content of unknown length
