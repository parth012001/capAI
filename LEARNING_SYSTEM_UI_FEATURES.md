  - `confidence_improved` - When AI confidence scores increase
  - `suggestion_ready` - When personalized suggestions are generated

**Visual Design:**
```
┌─ 🧠 AI Learning Feed ─────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Edit analyzed (2s ago)             │
│   "Professional → Friendly tone"      │
│   Confidence: 85% ↗️                  │
│                                       │
│ 🔍 Pattern detected (5m ago)          │
│   "You prefer shorter sentences"      │
│   Impact: High                        │
│                                       │
│ 💡 Suggestion ready (1m ago)          │
